### Welcome to the XPlain React Project challenge! You will push your code here.

#### Description
<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif">We are excited to announce a new design challenge for the login page of XPlain, the first AI tutor for Latin America. As the user's first point of contact, we want to ensure that our login page is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and user-friendly.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif">XPlain is a company that offers an innovative approach to education by using artificial intelligence to provide personalized tutoring to students. As such, we want our login page to reflect our commitment to cutting-edge technology and user experience. We are hiring React JS engineers and are using this project to evaluate candidates.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif">The challenge is to replicate the Figma design for the login page, which includes the functionality to toggle between showing the plain-text password and hiding it behind asterisks. Additionally, when a user enters their email and password and clicks on "Iniciar sesión," a pop-up should display what information was inputted. This pop-up should match the overall style of the page.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif">If a user clicks on "Olvidaste tu contraseña," they should be taken to a new page with a header. The same should happen when someone clicks on "Registrate aquí." Both of these pages can be empty for now.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif">It's important that the login page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. We highly recommend using React (hooks), HTML, and CSS to build this page. For navigating between pages, we suggest using </span></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif">, and if necessary, you can use Redux to manage the state of logged-in users.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif">Please refer to the Figma design (link provided below) for the layout and overall design of the login page. We encourage you to bring your creativity and design skills to the challenge.</span></span>
